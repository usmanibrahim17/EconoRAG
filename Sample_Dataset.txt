GDP Growth (annual %)
"GDP Growth Rate: A Comparative Study of Selected Developing Countries"
This paper analyzed the GDP growth rates of 20 developing countries over the past two decades using statistical methods. It showed that developing countries like India, Bangladesh, and Georgia had higher growth rates compared to others such as Hungary and South Africa, reflecting wide variation among developing economies. Notably, most developing countries are recovering steadily post-COVID-19 though their growth remains more volatile than developed countries, where GDP growth tends to be steadier but slower. Developed nations typically experience mature economic growth with smaller fluctuations, while developing countries' growth can be highly uneven, influenced by political stability, investment, and infrastructure development. The study underscores the persistent economic gap, with developed countries enjoying higher income levels though sometimes slower growth, while developing countries experience both rapid growth and uncertainties.

"Convergence Between Developed and Developing Countries: A Centennial Perspective"
This study examined long-term GDP per capita growth convergence between developed and developing countries over 100 years. It found some evidence that developing countries are narrowing the economic gap due to industrialization and technology transfer, but convergence is uneven, with regions like East Asia advancing faster than Africa or Latin America. Developed countries maintain higher baseline economic levels and more stable growth, whereas developing countries show catch-up growth driven by population growth and capital accumulation. However, many developing countries still face structural challenges limiting sustained convergence. The paper highlights the complexity of economic development, where catching up depends on institutional strength, human capital, and global economic integration.

Renewable Energy Consumption (% of Total Final Energy Consumption)
"Renewable energy and CO2 emissions in developing and developed nations: a panel estimate approach"
This comprehensive panel study covering 1970–2022 revealed that renewable energy adoption impacts developed and developing countries differently. Developed countries benefit from robust institutional frameworks and advanced technology that allow renewable energy to effectively reduce CO₂ emissions while supporting economic growth. Conversely, in developing countries, renewable utilization initially correlates with rising emissions until technology adoption and infrastructure improve sufficiently. This disparity reflects the institutional, financial, and technological gaps contributing to divergent energy transition pathways. The study emphasizes the need for customized renewable energy policies that consider development levels to achieve sustainable growth and emission reductions worldwide.

"The drivers of renewable energy: a global empirical analysis of developing and developed countries"
This analysis identifies key drivers of renewable energy use—economic development, energy prices, technological innovation, and policy incentives help explain the faster adoption in developed countries. Developing countries often lag due to high upfront costs, limited infrastructure, and weaker governance. Despite these obstacles, several developing nations have begun scaling up renewable energy, especially solar and wind, spurred by cost decreases and international aid. The paper calls for enhanced technological cooperation and financial support to bridge this gap, facilitating cleaner growth paths in developing countries comparable to those already achieved in developed economies.

Urban Population (% of Total Population)
"Major Trends in Population Growth Around the World"
The UN data reveals stark contrasts in urbanization: developing countries are experiencing rapid urban population growth fueled by rural migration and natural increases, leading to challenges like informal settlements and inadequate infrastructure. Developed countries, having already urbanized extensively, exhibit slower population growth due to aging populations and lower birth rates. These differences reflect varied stages of demographic transition and economic development impacting service provision, environmental management, and economic opportunities. Developed countries can focus on urban renewal and sustainability, whereas developing nations face the dual burden of urban infrastructure expansion and poverty alleviation.

"Urban land expansion: the role of population and GDP growth"
By analyzing over 300 cities worldwide, this study finds that population growth is the primary factor driving urban expansion, with GDP growth playing a supplementary role, especially in cities with strong governance. Developed countries, characterized by mature urban systems, manage expansion through planning and environmental regulation. Developing countries, lacking effective governance, often face rapid, unmanaged urban sprawl, exacerbating environmental degradation and social inequalities. The research highlights that the quality of governance and institutional capacity shapes how economic and demographic forces translate into sustainable urban development.

Industry (including construction), Value Added (% of GDP)
"Manufacturing Still Matters for Developing Countries"
Manufacturing remains a vital engine for economic growth and employment in developing countries, contrary to perceptions of declining industrialization. The study shows that while manufacturing employment growth has plateaued in China, it continues expanding in other developing nations, linking industrialization to economic diversification and poverty reduction. In developed countries, the economy increasingly focuses on services and high-tech sectors with higher value-added outputs. This distinction points to different stages of economic evolution, with developing nations relying on labor-intensive industries to boost incomes and infrastructure, while developed countries capitalize on innovation and technology-driven growth.

"Economic Diversification in Developing Countries"
This IMF paper emphasizes the need for developing countries to diversify beyond commodities into manufacturing and construction to achieve sustainable growth and resilience. Developed countries generally have more diversified economies with higher contributions from advanced services and technology sectors. Developing economies face risks from commodity price volatility and lack of sectoral breadth. Promoting industry and construction through policy support is crucial for catching up economically and reducing dependence on agriculture or resource extraction common in many developing countries.

Foreign Direct Investment, Net Inflows (% of GDP)
International reports show that developing countries generally attract higher FDI net inflows relative to GDP as they seek capital to fund industrialization and infrastructure development. However, these inflows are often more volatile and concentrated in specific sectors, increasing economic vulnerabilities. In contrast, developed countries receive more stable, technology-driven FDI that supports innovation and high-value industries. While FDI contributes positively to growth in both groups, the quality and stability of investments and institutional environments differ substantially.
Source: Our World in Data, World Bank, 2024​

A literature survey indicates that institutional quality is a key determinant of FDI's impact: developed countries benefit from mature regulatory frameworks that maximize spillovers and economic growth, whereas developing countries face challenges including political risk, corruption, and inadequate infrastructure. Policy reforms in developing countries are essential to attract sustainable and equitable FDI similar to patterns seen in developed markets.

Trade (% of GDP)
"Developing countries in global trade governance: comparing norms on inequality in the WTO and GSP schemes"
This analysis reveals how global trade policies create differentiated obligations and benefits for developing and developed countries. Developing countries have increased their global trade share but remain less integrated and more vulnerable to shocks. Developed countries maintain dominance in trade governance and set standards shaping global markets. The paper highlights the structural differences in trade participation and benefits, with developed countries benefiting more from high-value trade, while developing countries often depend on resource-intensive or low-value exports.

"International Trade and the Economies of Developing Countries"
Focused on African economies, this study describes international trade's dual effects: potential growth stimulus and risk of economic dependence on developed countries. Developing nations face barriers limiting market access and diversification. In contrast, developed countries enjoy a more balanced trade portfolio with access to advanced markets. This imbalance manifests in trade patterns, competitiveness, and economic resilience, underscoring the development-trade nexus shaped by historical, policy, and capacity factors.

CO₂ Emissions per Capita
"Analysis: Global CO2 emissions will reach new high in 2024 despite slower growth"
Emission data show that developed countries have largely stabilized or reduced per capita CO₂ emissions through technological advances and environmental policies. Developing countries, by contrast, continue increasing emissions driven by industrialization, energy demand, and urbanization. This divergence highlights the challenge of balancing economic development with climate goals, with developed countries leading decarbonization efforts and developing countries requiring support to transition without compromising growth aspirations.
Source: CarbonBrief, 2024​

"Renewable energy and CO2 emissions in developing and developed nations: a panel estimate approach"
Supporting these data, research shows that while developed countries have decoupled economic growth from emissions via renewable investments and energy efficiency, developing countries only achieve emission reductions once renewable consumption surpasses certain levels. Institutional, financial, and technological gaps impede this transition, stressing the need for tailored energy policies backed by international cooperation to address disparities in emissions trajectories.

Human Development Index (HDI)
UNDP reports consistently show developed countries scoring higher on the HDI due to better outcomes in health, education, and economic standards, reflecting advanced infrastructure and social welfare systems. Developing countries lag behind with greater inequality, lower life expectancy, and educational limitations. Although some developing countries have improved HDI components rapidly, gaps remain large and persistent globally, underscoring ongoing development challenges beyond GDP measures alone.

"Convergence Between Developed and Developing Countries"
Long-term data show slow but steady convergence in HDI-driving variables, though developing regions vary widely. Africa and parts of Latin America experience slower progress compared to emerging Asia. Developed countries maintain stable HDI through comprehensive health and education systems, while developing countries struggle with infrastructural deficits and social inequalities, limiting human development improvements.

Government Health Expenditure (% of GDP)
Studies show developed countries allocate a higher percentage of GDP to government health expenditure, reflecting stronger public health systems, universal coverage, and prioritization of healthcare infrastructure. Developing countries often have lower government health spending due to budget constraints, relying more on out-of-pocket and private spending, which affects healthcare quality and accessibility. This disparity contributes to divergent health outcomes, including maternal and infant mortality rates.

Private Health Expenditure (% of GDP)
Data indicate that in developing countries a larger share of health expenditure comes from private out-of-pocket payments, leading to inequities and financial hardships for vulnerable populations. Developed countries typically complement government spending with regulated private insurance systems. The differences reflect healthcare system capacity and social protection mechanisms substantially impacting access and health equity.

Population Growth Rate (annual %)
Population growth rates remain much higher in developing countries due to higher fertility and youthful populations, creating challenges for service provision and job creation. Developed countries, with aging populations and low birth rates, face different challenges like labor shortages and pension sustainability. These demographic contrasts shape economic policy priorities in each group dramatically.

Adolescent Birth Rate (per 1,000 Women Ages 15–19)
Adolescent birth rates are substantially higher in developing countries due to social norms, lower education levels, and limited access to reproductive health services. Developed countries have benefited from comprehensive sex education and healthcare, yielding much lower rates and improved maternal and child health outcomes. This indicator reflects broader gender inequality and health system capacity differences.

Maternal Mortality Rate (per 100,000 Live Births)
Maternal mortality remains alarmingly high in developing countries driven by poor healthcare access, under-resourced facilities, and socio-economic barriers. Developed countries have drastically lower rates, reflecting advanced maternal care and universal health coverage. Reducing the mortality gap requires major health system investments and policy reforms in developing nations.

Female Secondary Education Enrollment (% of Females)
Female secondary education enrollment rates are significantly higher in developed countries due to institutional support, legal frameworks, and social acceptance. Developing countries, while improving, still face cultural, economic, and infrastructural barriers limiting girls' education. Increased female education correlates strongly with broader development outcomes including health, economic participation, and fertility reduction.
